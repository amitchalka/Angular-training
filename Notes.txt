Projects are created in angular, not files. 
Node is a server side javascript framework. Backend support.

Node -> NPM -> CLI -> NG -> Angular.

To update: ng update @angular/cli or /core.

ng new myProjectName - makes a new project folder.
Libraries/Framework/Package - They are all js.

File types and their need:
app.component.css - styling
.html - layout
.spec - testing
.ts - logic

ng generate c component_name - generates a new component

app.module.ts - the file which stores the information regarding all the components. The
		component will not work if not included in this file.
main.ts - Has info regarding the module(bootstraps the module). Module has info regarding
 	  the application i.e it bootstraps the application.

ng build - converts all .ts files to js and bundles them together.

ngModel is a binding directive. Binding with the UI or javascript.
Directive - Angular attributes with html. eg: ngFor - 'for' loop for html. So its a logic directive.

All logical arguments start with a *. eg: *ngIf, *ngFor
